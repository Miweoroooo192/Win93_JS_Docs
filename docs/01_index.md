# Welcome to the Win93 Docs

If you want to make your own apps, this site is for you! 

This documentation comes with a full step-by-step tutorial on how to make your first app, a full description of what every single JS Function on Windows 93 does, and instructions for how to create an App Store Package.

# So what do I do now?

Before you get started with any of this, you'll need to know three things.

- The basics of JavaScript

- The basics of HTML

- The basics of having patience

Don't know any of those? We'll give you a bunch of links to learn it from, in the guide.

# The Guide

**THE GUIDE IS CURRENTLY STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND AS SUCH NOT AVAILABLE**

We made a full step-by-step guide, ready for beginners, that should teach you how to make your own app! We'll walk you through the very basics of creating a window, creating terminal apps, down to making a full text editor and packing it in a format so that you can easily share it and upload it to the official App Store.

Get started here: *[WORK IN PROGRESS]*
